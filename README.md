# beating-food101-paper
Beating an image classification paper by utilizing the fine tuning method

Fine tuning was used to pass the validation accuracy of Food101 paper. Even though only 50% of the data was used, the validation accuracy of 72.37% has been achieved. The validation accuracy is 50.76% in the paper.  

I have used mixed precision to speed up the process.

### Libraries that have been used:
* tensorflow
* tensorflow_datasets
* matplotlib.pyplot
